    <p>Eccentric.</p>
    <p>Charismatic.</p>
    <p>Out of control.</p>
    <p>Wise.</p>
    <p>Humble.</p>
    <p>A few words that have been used to describe Sydney’s greatest export since Tim Cahill. </p>
    <p>Born and raised in Sydney’s Inner West, Lil Nunu has been surrounded by Sydney’s creative 
        scene as well as a strong impact of street culture and crime from young. More recently, Nunu has jumped ships 
        and currently resides in the artistic hub of Den Haag, Netherlands where he study’s photography and art at one of the worlds top art schools. 
        Lil Nunu has been creating for almost a decade now, however until recently had been mainly focused on capturing beauty through photography and videography. Finally, 
        we get to see him in front of the camera and mic instead of behind. </p>
    <p>Lil Nunu is a big personality, exemplified by his egotistical yet vulnerable persona, 
        express both his love for himself and what he is capable of as well as living with his heart on his sleeve. 
        This image that Nunu has created, with heavy influences from the likes of Lil Peep, culminates on one of the 
        most visually pleasing, entertaining 
        and thought-provoking Instagram pages we have ever seen @lilnunu03.</p>
    <p>Us here at Full-Time Mag absolutely cannot wait for his debut song and music video to drop this December. We sat down and 
        had a chat with Nunu a couple of weeks ago, here’s what he had to say:</p>

        from Teto in my new song that is coming out soon. Also I get so much inspiration from my friends and 
        family, and the way they have supported me.

    <!-- Q10 -->
    <div class="qa-block">
      <div class="question">Are you interested in the arts?</div>
      <div class="answer">Yeah, life is boring without it. Creating feels like a necessity, 
        and consuming feels like the reward. A few years ago my dad put me onto the book ‘Just Kids’ 
        by Patti Smith and it was a pivotal moment for me. She showed me a different way of living, 
        that gave me the belief to go against the systematic lifestyle I grew up around. </div>

        snapped back with three and put me to the ground. </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Q12 -->
    <div class="qa-block">
      <div class="question">Have you ever wanted to love someone?</div>
      <div class="answer">I have loved before, life is nothing without love 
        especially from friends and family. 
        Love can hurt too but overall we need it to do more than just survive.</div>
